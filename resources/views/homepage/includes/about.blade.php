                  Started in 1971 by Mrs. Rosita T. Uy as a foam manufacturer in Cebu, Mandaue Foam has rapidly grown over the past 50 years because of its commitment to provide its customers with quality and value for money products. Today, Mandaue Foam is one of the countryâ€™s top 1000 corporations and has over 30 factories and showrooms nationwide. Its trademark products include its signature Flex Foam and Hotel Quality Gala Bed Mattress.

                  Soon after it started, Mandaue Foam sensed a need in the market for a more complete home store and it began to expand and diversify its product lines to include pillows, sofas, dining tables, bed frames, and other small home items. Today, Mandaue Foam continues to augment its product lines and innovate by offering customized furniture among others.
